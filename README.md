# Secure Password Storage System

## Overview

This project implements a secure password storage system that allows users to register and log in with strong passwords. It uses bcrypt for password hashing and SQLite for data storage. The system enforces password strength validation to ensure users choose strong passwords, preventing common password-related security vulnerabilities.

## Features
   - **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt hashing algorithm, which makes it difficult for attackers to retrieve the original password even if they gain access to the hashed values.

   - **Password Strength Validation**: Before registration, the system checks if the password meets specific strength requirements:
        - Minimum length of 8 characters
        - At least one uppercase letter
        - At least one lowercase letter
        - At least one digit
        - At least one special character (e.g., @, $, !, %, etc.)

  - **SQLite Database**: User information (email, password hash, and salt) is stored in a local SQLite database.

  - **User Registration & Login**: The system supports user registration (where email, password hash, and salt are stored) and login (where the password is checked against the stored hash and salt).

## Technologies Used
  - Python: For implementing the core logic of the password storage system.
  - bcrypt: For password hashing.
  - SQLite: For storing user credentials in a local database.
  - re (Regular Expressions): For validating password strength.

## Requirements
  1. Python 3.x
  2. bcrypt
  3. SQLite (comes with Python standard library)
  4. Argon2 (optional for additional password hashing methods)

## Install Dependencies

Before running the project, you need to install the required dependencies.
    
    pip install bcrypt

You will also need to ensure that SQLite is installed. If you're using Python, SQLite should already be included in your environment.


## Usage
**1. Setting Up the Database**

    The database will be automatically created when you run the program for the first time. It stores user emails, hashed passwords, and salts.

    To set up the database and create the users table, simply run the program. The table will be created if it does not already exist.

**2. Running the Application**

    To run the application, execute the app.py file:


         python app.py

**3. User Registration**

    When you run the application, you will be prompted to enter the following:

    1. Your email address
    2. Your password

The system will check if the password meets the strength requirements. If it does, the password will be hashed and stored in the database along with the email. If not, an error message will be displayed, and you will need to choose a stronger password.

**4. User Login
**
You can also test the login functionality by entering your email and password. The system will verify your credentials by checking the hashed password stored in the database.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of what the console might look like when you run the program:


    Enter your email: user@example.com
    Enter your password: StrongP@ssw0rd!
    User user@example.com registered successfully!

    Enter your email to login: user@example.com
    Enter your password to login: StrongP@ssw0rd!
    Login successful!

## Password Strength Validation Rules

The password must meet the following conditions:

 - At least 8 characters long
 - Contains at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
 - Contains at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
 - Contains at least one number (0-9)
 - Contains at least one special character (e.g., @, $, !, %)

## Security Notes

  - The project uses bcrypt for password hashing, which is a secure hashing algorithm designed to be slow to deter brute-force attacks.
  - Passwords are never stored in plaintext in the database. Only the hashed values and salts are stored, making it very difficult to recover the original password.

## Database Schema

The users table is structured as follows:

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    salt TEXT NOT NULL
    );
 - id: A unique identifier for each user.
 - email: The user's email address (must be unique).
 - password_hash: The hashed password (generated using bcrypt).
 - salt: The salt used during password hashing (generated by bcrypt).
